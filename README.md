# What is the Autovillage Starbound Mod?
Simply put, it is(will be) a fully-featured, automatic AI for NPC entities in Starbound.

Each NPC will have their own jobs, talents, hobbies, desires, and relationships.

NOTE: Most of this is in the planning stages.


## Why is this important for Starbound?
NPCs are currently very bland and generic. Giving an AI distinct characteristics gives it the flavour that players are looking for. An AI that can develop villages over time gives players something to come back to, binding them to a world.

## What are the advantages of autovillage NPCs?
Autovillage NPCs will have the capability to work completely independently of the player. It will be able to interact with objects on a generic scale, including future objects and those added by other mods.

# Features
## Thought
Autovillagers convey their thoughts via chat to players and other autovillagers.

* They will seek out objects they desire.
* They will combine different thoughts together.
* They will use synonyms and add or leave out words where it makes sense.
* They will stutter when they are scared or cold.

## Inventory
Autovillagers will have their own inventories, which they manage. They will try to use the best weapons and armor, and the most advanced tools that they can get their hands on. Their inventories can be expanded with backpacks and other equipment.

## Jobs
Autovillagers can be assigned jobs. Jobs are assigned by giving certain items to autovillagers (not yet finalized). (i.e. a gathering axe invokes the lumberjack job)
Autovillagers will acquire items relating to their jobs and perform their own duties.
